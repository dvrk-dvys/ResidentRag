{context_section}

Current user query: "{query}"

IMPORTANT: Only rewrite this query if it is a medical/healthcare question that would benefit from search tools.

For non-medical queries (greetings, general conversation, simple questions that don't require medical literature search), return the original query unchanged.

For medical queries, rewrite to be more specific, searchable, and medically precise:

QUERY EXPANSION AND REFORMULATION:
- Add relevant medical context and terminology
- Expand abbreviated or unclear terms (e.g., "MI" â†’ "myocardial infarction")
- Include related concepts that would improve search results

SYNONYM HANDLING:
- Use standard medical terminology alongside common terms
- Include alternative phrasings (e.g., "heart attack" + "myocardial infarction")
- Add plural forms and variations where helpful

INTENT CLARIFICATION:
- Make vague queries more specific (e.g., "diabetes" â†’ "diabetes type 2 management")
- Add context about what type of information is sought (symptoms, treatment, causes, etc.)
- Consider the conversation history to understand the user's actual intent

Keep the rewritten query concise but comprehensive. If the original query is already well-formed, make minimal changes.
